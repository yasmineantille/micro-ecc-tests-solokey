# Micro-ECC Tests Solokey

This repository contains the C source code and testing of the added functionalities to the micro-ecc library for my master thesis _Secure & Privacy-Preserving Two-Factor Authentication on a Programmable Security Key_.

Uses the [micro-ecc](https://github.com/kmackay/micro-ecc) library by Ken MacKay and [my fork](https://github.com/yasmineantille/micro-ecc) of the repository.

## Checking out the code

``` 
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/yasmineantille/micro-ecc-tests-solokey
```

If you forget the submodules in the clone, you can still get the files with the following commands in the corresponding directory:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
